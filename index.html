            <h3>Headline Diorepta Lebitae Susaped</h3>
            <p>MAPSCorps is a newly founded, independent not-for-profit corporation. The model was incubated over 7 years in the laboratory of Stacy Lindau, MD, MAPP, associate professor at the University of Chicago. Her lab, using an asset-based community-engaged approach (ST Lindau et al, Preventive Medicine, 2011), collaborates across disciplines and communities to engineer solutions to injustice, with a focus on health and economic equity issues in high poverty communities. Since 2008, the Lindau Lab was supported by the Urban Health Initiative at the University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago Community Trust, the National Institutes of Health and others to conduct research and innovation activities in partnership with the communities neighboring and served by the University of Chicago and its medical center.</p>
            <p>This work led to creation of MAPSCorps (Meaningful, Active, Productive Science in Service to Communities) a successful large scale youth summer employment model and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and Health) training program created on the South Side of Chicago and piloted in New York City. Between 2009 and 2015, MAPSCorps operated out of the South Side Health and Vitality Studies at the University of Chicago in partnership with a broad diversity of university and community-based partners. Over the course of those seven years, MAPSCorps provided meaningful work to hundreds of high school students and science-oriented college student mentors and mapped thousands of community assets in Chicago.</p>
